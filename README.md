# Running a TypeScript Project

This README explains how to set up, build, and run this Project.Â 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: Download and install the latest version from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm**: This comes bundled with Node.js. Verify installation with:
   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```
3. (Optional) **TypeScript Compiler**: Install globally if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

### 2. Compile TypeScript Files

TypeScript files (`.ts`) must be compiled into JavaScript (`.js`) before execution. Most projects include a script for this process. Run the following command to compile:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled files are typically placed in a `dist` or `build` directory.

### 3. Start the Application

To start the application, check for a `start` script in the `package.json`. Run:

```bash
npm start
```

Alternatively, if the entry point file is known (e.g., `dist/index.js`), you can run it directly:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

### 4. Run in Development Mode

If the project supports live reloading, you can run it in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This is especially useful for active development as it watches for file changes and recompiles automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Node.js or npm

If `node` or `npm` commands are not recognized, download and install Node.js from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Outdated or Missing Dependencies

If dependency installation fails, try forcing an update:

```bash
npm install --force
```

### Missing Environment Variables

Some projects require environment variables. Check for an `.env` file or consult the project documentation for setup instructions.

### TypeScript Compiler Issues

If the `tsc` command is missing, install TypeScript globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```


With these steps, your Project should be up and running!
